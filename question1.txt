This is a simple list component built using React. It consists of two components - SingleListItem and ListComponent.

The SingleListItem component is a functional component that takes in four props:

1. index: a number representing the index of the item in the list
2. isSelected: a boolean indicating whether the item is selected or not
3. onClickHandler: a function to be called when the item is clicked
4. text: the text to be displayed for the item
It renders an li element with a background color that depends on the value of isSelected prop. It also attaches an onClick event handler to the li element which calls the onClickHandler function with the index as a parameter.

The ListComponent is also a functional component that takes in one prop:

items: an array of objects representing the items to be displayed in the list. Each object should have a text property that represents the text to be displayed for that item.
It initializes a state selectedIndex using the useState hook. It also uses the useEffect hook to reset the selectedIndex state to null whenever the items prop changes.

It defines a handleClick function that takes an index parameter and updates the selectedIndex state to that value.

It then maps over the items array and renders a SingleListItem component for each item. It passes the text, index, isSelected, and onClickHandler props to the SingleListItem component.

Finally, the ListComponent is exported as the default export of the module. It is also wrapped in the memo function which ensures that it only re-renders when its props have changed.
